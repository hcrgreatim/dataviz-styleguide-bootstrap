  <h3>Bar Chart</h3>

  <p>The classic Bar Chart uses either horizontal or vertical bars (column chart) to show discrete, numerical comparisons across categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared and the other axis represents a discrete value scale. The Bar Chart's discrete data is categorical data.</p>

  <p>As a variation of the Bar Chart, Muti-Set Bar Chart is used when two or more data series are plotted side-by-side and grouped together under categories, all on the same axis.It’s usually to compare grouped variables or categories to other groups with those same variables or category types. The downside of Multi-Set Bar Charts is that they become harder to read the more bars you have in one group.</p>

  <h4>Best practices</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Use consistent colors throughout the chart. A specific bar can be highlighted with a different shade.</li>
      <li>Always start at the zero baseline</li>
      <li>The width of the space between the bars should be about half of width of the bars.</li>
      <li>Use horizontal labels to improve readability.</li>
      <li>Don’t use any shadow or 3D effect on the bars as they contain no information or data.</li>
      <li>The shading of the bars should move from lightest to darkest when it’s Muti-Set Chart.</li>
      <li>The bars should be ranked from the largest to the smallest or vice versa when it’s horizontal bar chart (there are some exceptions like they ranked in alphabetical order to facilitate reading)</li>
      <li>Keep the negative number on the left side of baseline and positive number on the right side of baseline.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Line Chart</h3>
  <p>A line chart reveals trends or progress over time and can be used to show many different categories of data. You should use it when you chart a continuous data set.</p>

  <p>Line Graphs are used to display quantitative values over a continuous interval or time period. A Line Graph is most frequently used to show trends and analyze how the data has changed over time. The line's journey across the graph can create patterns that reveal trends in a dataset. Unlike a bar chart, the line char does not require a zero baseline.</p>

  <p>When grouped with other lines (other data series), individual lines can be compared to one another. However, avoid using more than 3-4 lines per graph, as this makes the chart more cluttered and harder to read. A solution to this is to divide the chart into smaller multiples (have a small Line Graph for each data series)
  </p>

  <h4>Best practices</h4>

  <ul>
      <li>Use solid lines only.</li>
      <li>Use the right weight so the line can stand out against the grid line but also show the twists and turns of the line</li>
      <li>Don't plot more than 4 lines to avoid visual distractions.</li>
      <li>Use the right height so the lines take up roughly 2/3 of the y-axis' height.</li>
      <li>Keep the grid lines thin and the baseline slightly thicker than the rest of the grid lines.</li>
      <li>Keep it simple and use natural increments</li>
      <li>Avoid labeling at long distance, try to label the lines directly </li>
      <li>Use a legend only when space is tight and the lines intersect extensively.</li>
      <li>The order of the legend should match the ranking of the end points</li>
      <li>No shadow and 3D</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Mixed Chart</h3>

  <p>A dual axis chart allows you to plot data using two y-axes and a shared x-axis. It's used with two data sets, one of which is based on a continuous set of data and another which is better suited to being grouped by category. This should be used to visualize a correlation or the lack thereof between these two data sets.</p>

  <h4>Best practices</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>Use the y-axis on the left side for the primary variable because brains are naturally inclined to look left first.
      <li>Use different graphing styles to illustrate the two data sets, as illustrated above.</li>
      <li>Choose contrasting colors for the two data sets.</li>
      <li>Always label the scale clearly to avoid any confusion</li>
  </ul>
